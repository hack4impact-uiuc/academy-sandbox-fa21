      <h1>WHY ZUTARA WAS ROBBED</h1>
          <h3>Explained congress-prep style by Eesha Barua and other parties.</h3>
        <h2>Framework: Thematic Continuity in ATLA</h2>
            <h4> <i> From a thematic, narrative standpoint it makes more sense for a person with Katara’s character to 
              end up with a person like Zuko. It reaffirms the crucial fabric of ATLA’s story that binds together many 
              other plot points of the series, and contradicting this central theme in ATLA diminishes the entire show’s 
              impact and consistency. </i> </h4>
              <h5>Value Criterion: I take BALANCE as the highest value of a relationship for the following reasons. </h5>
        <h2> <b> CONTENTION 1: The theme of BALANCE most definitely drives the creation, development, and resolutions of ATLA.</b> </h2>
          <h3>This show is full of commentary on spirituality, destiny and balance in the world. </h3>
        <h2>Subpoint A : <i>Exposition / Balance. </i>The purpose of the Avatar is to restore balance to the world.</h2>
          <h3>The Avatar is uniquely powerful to single handedly restore balance to the world because of their ability 
            to bend all four elements.</h3>
            <h4>The exposition of ATLA and the premise for this story to even exist is precedented on the intense pursuit 
              of balance in the Avatar Universe, thus it must be the lens through which we examine character development 
              and what is most beneficial to a character’s personal growth and self-actualization.</h4>
        <h2>Subpoint 2: <i> Development / Spirituality. </i> Daoist philosophy of balance has resolved mid-story and character 
                arcs in Avatar.</h2>
          <h3>The Siege of the North Arc </h3>
            <h4>This arc is the most obvious in its reliance on Daoist philosophy to restore balance. The Fire Nation 
              became stronger after Commander Zhao killed Tui, the moon spirit. It was only subdued after La assumed Aang’s 
              body in the avatar state and the spirit only ceased its destruction and rampage after Yue brought life back 
              into Tui. The thematic element of Yin and Yang is heavily used to add tension to and resolve this arc.</h4>
              <h5> <u> Koh //  The Siege of the North, Part 2 // Book 1 </u> </h5>
              <h5>“You've already met them, actually. Tui and La, your moon and ocean, have always circled each other in an 
                eternal dance. They balance each other. Push and Pull. Life and Death. Good and Evil. Yin and Yang.”</h5>

                <center><img
                    alt={la}
                    src={la}
                    width="600"
                    height="600"
                  /></center>
              <h5>This imagery is pretty vocal in the implications of romance between the two spirits. Furthermore, the 
                Daoist philosophy of Yin and Yang strongly implies that balance ideally exists between two beings that 
                complement each other. The Avatar is the SINGULAR exception to this norm, as the Avatar is <b> expected to 
                single handedly achieve balance. </b> ( Which is important to understand later ) </h5>
          <h3>The Cave of Two Lovers</h3>
              <h5><u>Secret Tunnel!!! guy // The Cave of Two Lovers // Book 2</u></h5>
              <h5>"Two lovers, forbidden from one another</h5>
              <h5>A war divides their people</h5> 
              <h5>And a mountain divides them apart</h5> 
              <h5>Built a path to be together..."</h5>
              <center><img
                    alt={cave}
                    src={cave}
                    width="600"
                    height="600"
                  /></center>
              <h5>Again, the imagery here quite directly signifies that romance blooms in beings from opposite worlds but 
                parallel characteristics, another nod to Yin and Yang.</h5>
          <h3>The Great Divide</h3>
              <h5>The differences between the Gan Jin and the Zhang tribe are disparate, but surprisingly parallel. 
                They both trace back to the same origin story. </h5>
                <h6>Almost too noticeably, one tribe ends in -in, Gan Jins, and the other tribe ends in -ang, the Zhang. 
                  This is another spiritual nod to the nature of village names in Taoist mainland China (the influence 
                  for the Earth Kingdom in the Avatar Universe, as the Earth Kingdom enompasses most of Asia).</h6>
              <h5><u>John Bellaimey // the Hidden Meanings of Yin and Yang, Ted-Ed // Aug 2013</u></h5>
              <h5>Villages on the sunny side of a valley in China have names like Liuyang or Shiyang, but on the shady side, 
                for example, of the Yangtze River Valley, there’s Jiangyin.</h5>
            <h4>Let’s examine the central conflict in this episode.</h4>
              <h5> <u>The Great Divide //  Avatar Wiki // 2005 </u> </h5>
                <h6>The Gan Jins tell Katara of their tribal forefather, an earthbender named Jin Wei, who was tasked with the job 
                  of taking the sacred crystal orb from a gate in the east to a gate in the west as part of a redemption ritual. 
                  They claim that, as he neared the western gate, Jin Wei was assaulted by a thief, a Zhang named Wei Jin, who 
                  stole the orb out of greed. The Zhangs, on the other hand, tell Sokka that their ancestor, Wei Jin, found Jin Wei 
                  passed out on the ground near the western gate. Wei Jin stopped to help the man and was told about the redemption 
                  ritual and the orb's importance. Rejecting assistance, Jin Wei asked Wei Jin to take the orb back to his tribe, 
                  which Wei Jin did. Upon arriving at Gan Jin's village, however, Jin Wei's tribe arrested him for stealing the orb and 
                  imprisoned him for twenty years. Both sides claim that they will never forget the terrible injustice dealt to them by the other.</h6>

                    height="600"
                  /></center>
            <h4>This episode is resolved with an (albeit phony) understanding that Wei Jin and Jin Wei had a special relationship as brothers 
              and coexisted peacefully. This nod to balance reaffirms the sheer amount of story-building power in the theme of balance in ATLA.</h4>
